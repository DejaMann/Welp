# About

Locals Only is a Yelp-inspired clone for the taco trucks, stands and holes-in-the-wall in my hometown. I am passionate about the tight-knit community that I am from and thought this would be a fun way to especially highlight places that aren't on Yelp or are known primarily by word of mouth.

# Challenges

- Issues with MongoDB accepting data prevented me from creating my own API as intended.
- Need more reps with CSS especially, JS and React.js
    - More reps with routing
- File structure -  I infrequently have issues with importing because of file path issues.
- Better planning in the beginning to avoid restarting/confusion 


# Positives
