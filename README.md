# About

Locals Only is a Yelp-inspired clone for the taco trucks, stands and holes-in-the-wall in my hometown. I am passionate about the tight-knit community that I am from and thought this would be a fun way to especially highlight places that either were initially or are known primarily by word of mouth.
